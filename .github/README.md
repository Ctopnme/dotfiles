# dotfiles
Using a bare git repo following [this tutorial](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).

This readme might be lengthy as I try to keep it as informative as possible, including description of the files and sources that I used. Mainly for myself but also for any curious minds that somehow find this repository.

## Finding Sink ID
To find your sink ID run the command:
```
    $ pactl list sinks
```

## Lock screen
The lock script makes use of i3lock and ImageMagick. It was inspired by
[BetterLockScreen](https://github.com/pavanjadhaw/betterlockscreen/blob/master/README.md)
and [i3lock-fancy](https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy).

When I log in it also runs the script with a command line argument to create a
fake login screen. I am automatically logged in to tty and the lock script is
then run. I followed
[this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/42359/how-can-i-autologin-to-desktop-with-systemd)
post to set up autologin.

## Screenshotting
The screenshotting bindings I have were found
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/65vis5/screenshot_commands_from_my_i3_config/).
Will probably looking into changing this soon.
